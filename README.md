# Let's Travel

## Project Summary
This app can give users some recommendations about the places worth visiting. It can also provide suggestions about user's agendas such that they can just follow the agenda instead of worrying about where to go. Along the route, the users can adjust the agenda according to their wishes.

## Outline of Features
- Search for a place (maybe a city), and the app can provide a list of sights in that place.
- Users can select the sights they are interested in, so that the app can generate an agenda for users.
- Users can adjust the agenda during their travel.
- Users can add friends and chat with them.
- Users can share a place or sight to their friends within the app.
- Ability to create groups for friends.
- Rate a specific sight and post comments to it.
- Post travel experience (texts and photos) to the public or friends.
